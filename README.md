# Orlando Dog Park Connection
---------------------------------------------
What do you do when you want to go to a dog park to make a new friend for you and your canine side-kick, but then you arrive at your favorite dog park to find nobody there?

Well... Orlando Dog Park Connection is your go-to app to find some human friends, that also have the love of dogs. Or why else would you be here?

It's easy... to locate others with the same interests as you just input the date and time of your pending Doggie-Play-Date, along with the dog-park your attending, the breed you'll be bring along, and some additional comments (like what you'll be wearing), so others can locate you, and click 'Add Playdate'.

Know of a cool doggie hangout, not on our map? Drop us a comment!
